# Clean All

## Overview

Type **Clean All** to clean up all collection sections. Claude will keep the 5 most recent pages per section and move all older pages to the 🗑️ Clean staging page under Admin. If the Clean page does not exist, create it first.

## Logic Per Section

1. Fetch all child pages under the section
2. Sort by date — newest first
3. Keep pages 1–5 in place
4. Move pages 6 and older to 🗑️ Clean (page ID: `36ee3c20-a8ee-815f-9f9b-ee2e0129711c`)
5. If 🗑️ Clean does not exist, create it under Admin first

## After Clean All

> ⚠️ **Manual step required:** Go to 🗑️ Clean (`36ee3c20-a8ee-815f-9f9b-ee2e0129711c`) and permanently delete the pages that were moved there. Claude cannot delete pages — this must be done manually in Notion.
